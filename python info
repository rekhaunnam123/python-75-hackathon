GARBAGE COLLECTION:
  
      A module represents python code that perform specific task.Garbage collector is a module in python that is useful to delete objects
      from memory which are not used in the program or maintains count for each object.When an object is referenced twice,its reference 
      count will be 2.When an object has some count and if it is being used in he program and hence garbage collector will not remove it 
      from memory.When an object is found with a reference count 0,the object is not used by the program and hence it can be deleted from  
      memory.

FROZEN BINARIES:
   
     When a  software is developed in python,there are two ways to provide the software to the end of user.The first way is to provide the. 
     pyc files to the user.The user will install PVM in his computer and run the byte code instructions of the .pyc files.
  
    The other way is to provide the .pyc files,PVM along with necessary python library and PVM will be converted into a single executable
    file,so that the user can directly execute that file by double clicking on it.This way of converting the python programs into true 
    executables is called frozen binaries.
